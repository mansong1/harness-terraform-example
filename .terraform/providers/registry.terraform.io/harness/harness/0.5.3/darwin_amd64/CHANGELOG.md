BREAKING CHANGES:

* Anyone using either on-prem or compliance clusters (anything other than `app.harness.io`) will need to update their provider endpoint configuration. The `/api` should be dropped from the configuration since this is now implied. For example, if you were previously setting this:

```terraform
provider "harness" {
  endpoint = "https://my.domain.com/api"
}
```

It should now be:
```terraform
provider "harness" {
  endpoint = "https://my.domain.com"
}
```

* Fixes delegate not found panic [#64](https://github.com/harness/terraform-provider-harness/issues/64)
